## Hi, I'm Simon 🙋‍♂️
As a Business Analytics Masters student, I enjoy using data to drive business decisions. I excel in communicating my findings to diverse audiences and have a broad business background. With a strong foundation in statistics and prior consulting experience, I am ready to tackle any data challenge. But I have a serious weakness: cake.

- 🗄️ The published code is meant to archive some of my work.
